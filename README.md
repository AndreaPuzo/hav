# Hav
Hav is working in progress stack-based abstract machine for future programming language Hyper.
Hav means 'Ocean' in Norwegian, so I use it as a wish that Hav can grow large enough for the needs of many programmers. In the next versions will come specific packages to interact with the operating system, connect to the network, graphics support with SDL2 and OpenGL and much more.

## Why should i use Hav?
Good question, I don't know ;). Perhaps because it is still in the embryonic stage so you could help me implement new features. Hav is small but I think it has great potential, if you want to get on the boat contact me and I will be happy to hear your ideas!

## Hav 0.0.0
* basic types (byte, word, dword and qword)
* format algorithm
