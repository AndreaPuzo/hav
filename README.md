# Hav
Hav is working in progress stack-based abstract machine for future programming language ugolang (or Hyper).
Hav means 'Ocean' in Norwegian, so I use it as a wish that Hav can grow large enough for the needs of many programmers. In the next versions will come specific packages to interact with the operating system, connect to the network, graphics support with SDL2 and OpenGL and much more.
